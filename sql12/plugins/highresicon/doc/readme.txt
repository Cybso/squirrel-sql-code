Hires icons and smooth icon scaling Plugin.
Provides high resolution icons for  HiDPI screens.

Note:
Due to OpenJDK bug #JDK-8257500, see https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8257500,
this Plugin prevents SQuirreL's Sessions from being finalized and garbage collected.
The bug is due to be fixed in Java 17. As soon as this Java version is available and
SQuirreL is compatible with it, which usually happens shortly after the release, users
of this Plugin should switch to Java 17.
